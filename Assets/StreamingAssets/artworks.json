    "description": "The Mona Lisa, painted by Leonardo da Vinci in the early 1500s, is one of the most iconic portraits in the world. The subject, believed to be Lisa Gherardini, is known for her mysterious smile and direct gaze. Da Vinci used a technique called sfumato to create soft transitions between tones and achieve a lifelike quality. The painting has been housed in the Louvre Museum since the French Revolution. Its fame skyrocketed after it was stolen in 1911 and recovered two years later.",

    "description": "Starry Night was painted by Vincent van Gogh in 1889 while he was in an asylum in Saint-Rémy-de-Provence. The painting captures a swirling, dreamlike night sky over a quiet village, reflecting van Gogh’s emotional turmoil and fascination with the cosmos. Bold, expressive brushstrokes give the stars and sky a sense of movement. Although it wasn't appreciated in his lifetime, it’s now one of the most beloved pieces of modern art. The cypress tree in the foreground connects earth and sky, symbolizing death and eternity.",

    "artist": "Johannes Vermeer",
    "year": "1665",
    "description": "This painting, created by Johannes Vermeer around 1665, depicts a young girl wearing an exotic turban and a large pearl earring. Her glance over her shoulder creates an intimate connection with the viewer. The lack of background and her simple attire draw focus to her delicate features and enigmatic expression. Art historians believe it wasn’t meant to be a formal portrait, but rather a tronie — a study of facial expression and costume. The painting has been nicknamed the 'Mona Lisa of the North' due to its mysterious allure.",
